## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   A Google API Key with the Gemini API enabled. You can get one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ashleywyattjapan/aiChatBot.git](https://github.com/ashleywyattjapan/aiChatBot.git)
    cd aiChatBot
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    This keeps your project dependencies isolated.
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages**
    A `requirements.txt` file is recommended for managing dependencies. If you don't have one, you can install the packages directly:
    ```sh
    pip install flask langchain langchain-google-genai langgraph python-dotenv
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory and add your Google API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Run the Flask application**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

6.  **Open your browser**
    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the application live!

## Usage

Once the application is running, simply type your message into the input box at the bottom of the screen and press "Send" or hit Enter. The chatbot will process your message and display its response in the chat window. Use the toggle in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark modes.
